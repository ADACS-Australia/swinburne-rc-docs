# Swinburne Research Cloud - Quickstart Guide

Welcome! Here we will show you how to quickly get up and running with a **basic virtual machine**, also referred to as an **'instance'**, on the Swinburne Research Cloud.

For new users, we recommend following the steps in this guide carefully, using a trial project.

!!! info " TLDR - What is it the Swinburne Research Cloud?"
    It is a **FREE alternative** to commercial clouds, such as AWS and Microsoft Azure, for Australian researchers in astronomy and astrophysics.

## Introduction
The Swinburne Research Cloud is one of the physical nodes of the national **Nectar Research Cloud**, which is implemented and managed using **OpenStack**, an open source cloud computing framework.

It is what is know as **Infrastructure-as-a-Service** (IaaS), providing researchers with on-demand, raw IT infrastructure such as CPUs, networking and storage, in a flexible and scalable manner.
In simpler terms: it gives you access to **virtual hardware that you can administer in whatever way you choose**.

Typical uses include:

- Deploying compute resources for running simulation and data analysis software.
- Hosting of websites, databases, web applications and other online resources.
- Establishing customised access to online data sets and data analysis tools.
- Hosting of online research tools and domain-specific virtual laboratories.

### Trial Project
When first joining, all researchers initially get a trial project with 2 virtual CPUs allocated for 3 months.
This means you can run 1 medium or 2 small virtual machines for three months. Or 1 small VM for a total of 6 months.


### Astronomers
To get more resources, you need to join a full project or apply for one. Australian Austromers can request access to resources available only to them on the Swinburne zone. But we recommend going through the steps of [launching a simple virtual machine](getting-started.md) in your trial project before applying.
