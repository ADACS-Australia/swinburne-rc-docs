# Applications
Nectar provides a set of "cloud-ready" applications for quick and easy deployment, implemented using the [OpenStack Murano Project](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Murano){target="_blank"}.

These application packages automate the deployment of cloud resources as well as the subsequent system administrations tasks that are required to setup a server, such as a Jupyter Notebook or an R-Studio server.

Instead of manually spinning-up a virtual machine, and then connecting to it to install and configure the software yourself, apps provide a simple user interface from which you can initiate the whole process.

You can find a guide for [launching an R-Studio server](https://tutorials.rc.nectar.org.au/applications/01-overview){target="_blank"} on the Nectar tutorials page. The steps for launching a Jupyer Notebook server are similar. Note that the R-Studio app also includes a Shiny server along with remote-desktop-based access via either your browser or X2Go.
